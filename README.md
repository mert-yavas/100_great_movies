# Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
## Overview
Hi, I'm Mert and today is day 45 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. In this project, I created a Python script called 'main.py' for web scraping using BeautifulSoup. The script extracts film titles from a web page and writes them to a text file.
Note: Since there was HTML training between days 40-44, I spent these days without a project. 

## Project Description
The script uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape a web page and extract the film titles. It then writes the titles to a text file in reverse order. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple introduction to web scraping with Python.

## How to Run
To use the Web Scraping script, follow these steps:

* Open the Python script: main.py
```bash
   python main.py
```
* Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (requests and beautifulsoup4).
* Run the script to extract the film titles and create a text file.
* Make sure Python is installed on your system.
## Project Files
* main.py: Main Python script for web scraping and extracting film titles.
## Customisation
The script focuses on simplicity and basic web scraping concepts. You can explore and modify it according to your needs. Customise the URL, HTML tags and classes if you are scraping a different website.

## Dependencies
The project is based on the following Python libraries:

* Requests: For making HTTP requests to retrieve web page content.
* BeatifulSoup: for parsing HTML and extracting data.
  
## Education Insights
Through this project you can learn about the following:

* Web Scraping Basics: Learn the basics of web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
* HTML Parsing: Understand how to parse HTML content to extract relevant information.
* Data Extraction: Explore data extraction methods based on HTML tags and classes.
* File Processing: Learn how to write data to a text file using Python.
## Conclusion
I hope you find the Web Scraping script useful for getting started with web scraping in Python. Feel free to explore, modify and adapt the script to suit your specific needs. Happy coding!

Note: Be respectful when scraping websites and always check the website's terms of service.
